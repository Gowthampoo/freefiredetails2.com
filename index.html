 Originally released in
 September 2017 as a beta for
 Android and iOS, Free Fire
 arrived at a time when
 battle royales were still
 relatively new. In fact, the
 first beta of the game was
 released even before PUBG
 had landed on PC, the latter
 ofwhich launched the entire
 genre into mainstream appeal
 This rise in popularity of
 battle royales, coupled with
 the growing interest in
 mobilegaming, made Free Fire
 one of the most downloaded
 titles in the Play Store, a
 title that they still hold
 today, 3 years later.

 Free Fire is developed by
 111 Dots Studio using Unity
 3D, an engine that is
 popular among indie
 developer studios since it’s
  free and has a wide variety
 of assets readily available
 for downloading. The engine
 is also very versatile and
 gives plenty of features and
 creative freedom for those
 who master its intricacies.
